Mobile App
Once the Enviro Noise Partner app is downloaded to your phone from the App Store
®
, your B&K 2245 sound level meter can be wirelessly controlled from your phone – you can even control multiple sound level meters simultaneously. All measurement capabilities are available from the app, with intuitive measurement profile screens that enable you to pinch the graph to zoom or swipe it to move back and forth through time. This makes it very easy to mark events and isolate sounds so that you can, for example, exclude a barking dog from a measurement. Measurement audio can be streamed to your phone while measuring, useful in situations where you cannot be physically close to the sound level meter, or to listen for wind-induced noise. Via the app interface, pictures, text and voice notes, and videos can be embedded with the measurements to document your work.
PC App
With the accompanying PC app, all data can be transferred to a PC, wirelessly or with the supplied USB cable. Just like the mobile app, the Enviro Noise Partner PC app is an excellent tool for adding markers for events and isolating sounds for further investigation or exclusion. These tasks are made even easier with the app’s powerful audio playback tools, such as pitch-corrected, high-speed playback for reviewing long recordings. Measurements can be exported to customizable Microsoft
®
Excel
®
templates for fast, easy and consistent reporting.
