    "A linear, time-invariant system’s response to such an \nimpulse contains all the information on the system and, as such, \nis convenient for analysis and storage. ",
    "DIRAC measures and \nsaves acoustical impulse responses and calculates acoustical \nparameters from impulse responses.\n",
    "Other Excitation Signals\nThrough the method of deconvolution, DIRAC can also calculate \nthe impulse response using other excitation signals, thereby \nenabling the use of loudspeaker sound sources. ",
    "These sources \nfeature a better directivity, frequency spectrum and reproducibility \nthan impulsive sound sources, and offer increased dynamic range \nthrough deconvolution. ",
    "Examples of suitable non-impulsive \nexcitation signals are the MLS (maximum length sequence) \nsignal, the sweep or swept sine (sine with frequency increasing \nlinearly or exponentially with time), white noise and pink noise.\n",

    "All stimuli can be used in an intermittent mode which includes a \nbackground noise measurement.\n",
    "Signal Sources\nThe stimulus can either be generated by DIRAC itself and played \nback through an attached sound device, or it can be generated \nexternally, for instance from a CD player, Echo Speech Source or \nHBK 2755 Smart Power Amplifier.\n",
    "When the stimulus playback and the microphone input are both \nusing the same device, with the same sample clock, as is the \ncase for most USB devices, then the measurement is called \nsynchronous. ",

    "DIRAC supports three different kinds of calibration:\n1. ",
    "System calibration: Enables the measurement of the sound \nstrength (G) and related parameters, and improves the accuracy \nof lateral fraction (LF and LFC) measurements if needed. \n",
    "System calibration is best performed in a reverberation \nchamber, but it can also be performed in a free-field \nenvironment, for instance, in situ on a large stage.\n",

    "Input level calibration: Enables measurement of absolute sound \npressure (or voltage) levels and related parameters (Leq,I). \n",
    "3. ",
    "Source-receiver distance calibration: Allows the measurement \nof the source-receiver distance for synchronous setups, and is \nusually performed using a loop-back cable.\n",
    "For ISO 3382-3 measurements, all three calibrations are required.\n",
    "Impulse Response Views\nDIRAC can display an impulse response in several ways. ",
    "The \nenergy-time curve shows the average energy progression or \nhighlights the energy peaks; the forward integration curve shows \nthe cumulative energy progression, and the decay curve displays \nthe backwards integrated energy progression.\n",

    "Other Applications\nScale Model Measurement\nTo predict the acoustics of, for instance, a concert hall that is \nbeing designed but not yet realized, you can measure impulse \nresponses in a scaled down model of the hall. ",
    "After DIRAC has \nconverted the scale model impulse responses to real-world \nimpulse responses, you can analyse them in the usual way. ",
    "For \nscale model measurements using an impulsive source, DIRAC can \npost-average the impulse responses with automatic alignment.\n",

    "2  Sound intensity spectrum\nWe live in an ever-noisier world, and our awareness of noise has \nescalated dramatically, increasing the demand for noise-friendly \nsurroundings. ",
    "Manufacturers are aware of this and are labelling \ntheir machines, be they refrigerators or turbines, with their noise \noutput according to national and international standards. \n",
    "Machines often consist of parts made by sub-suppliers, so the \nnoise labelling of each part is important as it enables the \nmanufacturer to predict the noise output from a new machine. \n",
    "The stringent EU Machine Directives have also played a major \nrole in the enforcement of product labelling.\n",
    "Support During Measurement\nFig. ",
    "3  Left: Measurement quality indicators: Dynamic capability and overload are \nchecked and indicated; Right: Housekeeping during measurement is done by \ncoloured segments\nFeatures during measurement include quality control of the \nmeasurement by means of quality indicators, a back-erase to the \nlatest pause (or back-erase the latest scan), and aural feedback to \nearphones for step-by-step guidance and information. ",
    "This gives \nwarnings regarding overloads and failed criteria, and a periodic \nsound signal assists you in keeping a steady scanning pace.\n",
    "During the measurement you can use the Surface View for \nhousekeeping. ",
    "The coloured segments on top of the image of the \nmeasurement object are ideal for keeping track of the \nmeasurement process.\n",
    "Measurement Procedure\nConsider a noise source standing on a reflecting floor. ",
    "Imagine a \nvirtual box that completely envelops the source. ",
    "The sound power \nfrom the source will radiate through the five free segments of the \nbox (right, left, front, rear, top). ",
    "Measure the average sound intensity \nfor each of the five segments and the analyzer will calculate the \nresulting sound intensity and sound power for each segment and \nfor the total box, taking the segment areas into account.\n",
    "As an aid to scanning, a wire frame can be used to indicate the \nlocation of segments; alternatively, markers on the floor can be \nused to indicate the base of the box and a tape measure to show \nits height.\n",
    "Measure one segment at a time, scanning it at a constant speed \nand covering equal areas in equal time. ",

    "Product: Sound Level Meters\nURL: https://www.hbkworld.com/en/products/instruments/handheld/sound-level-meters\n================================================================================\n\nWHAT IS A SOUND LEVEL METER\nA sound level meter is a measuring instrument, designed to measure sound levels in a standardized way.\n",
    "Commonly referred to as a sound meter, noise meter, decibel meter, or sound pressure level (SPL) meter, a sound level meter is designed to respond to sound in approximately the same way as the human ear.\n",
    "The purpose of a sound level meter is to give objective, reproducible measurements of sound pressure levels (SPL).\n",
    "HOW DOES A SOUND LEVEL METER WORK?\n",
    "At its very core, a sound level meter basically consists of a microphone, a preamplifier, a signal processing unit, and a display.\n",
    "The most suitable type of microphone for a sound level meter is a condenser microphone, which combines precision with measurement reliability. ",
    "The microphone converts the sound signal to an equivalent electrical signal. ",
    "The electrical signal produced by the microphone is at a very low level and must be enhanced by a preamplifier, before reaching the main processor.\n",
    "Signal processing applies frequency weightings and time weightings to the signal, as specified by international standards such as IEC 61672 – 1, which a sound level meter complies with.\n",
    "MEASUREMENT APPLICATIONS\nSound level meters and analyzers are used to measure and manage noise from a variety of sources. ",
    "They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\n",
    "In urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas. ",
    "To ensure noise regulations are followed, noise is measured from a variety of sources as sports events, outdoor concerts, parks, and residential- or commercial neighbours. ",
