Pre-set measurement settings make it very easy to \nset up a measurement. \nIn this example, the setup for an ISO 3382-3 measurement is \nchosen. The intermittent pink MLS (maximum length sequence) \nexcitation signal is selected.\nFig. 7  Typical DIRAC setup, with a 10.9 second MLS excitation \nLonger excitation times can be used to suppress background \nnoise. Each doubling of excitation time results in a 3 dB reduction \nin background noise. In this case, a reverberation time of around \n1 second is expected, and an excitation time of 10.9 seconds will \nimprove the impulse response-to-noise ratio (INR) by over 10 dB \ncompared to traditional measurement methods.\nPressing the Test button runs the MLS signal continuously for \nadjusting speaker output level and microphone input level.\nPressing the Start button will run the measurement and \ncalculation, and present the impulse responses (Fig. 8). These \nshould have a clean \u2018tail\u2019 with no background noise.

        "original_text": "Although it \nmay not be easy to describe accurately what you hear, this \nmethod gives you an impression of whether music would sound \npleasant or speech would be intelligible in this room. DIRAC uses \nthis principle as the basis for measuring the acoustical properties \nof a system through impulse responses.\nFig. 1  Basic principle of impulse response measurement\nImpulse Responses\nThe mathematical impulse, or Dirac delta function, named after \nthe theoretical physicist Paul A.M. Dirac, is infinitely short and has \nunit energy. A linear, time-invariant system\u2019s response to such an \nimpulse contains all the information on the system and, as such, \nis convenient for analysis and storage. DIRAC measures and \nsaves acoustical impulse responses and calculates acoustical \nparameters from impulse responses.\nOther Excitation Signals\nThrough the method of deconvolution, DIRAC can also calculate \nthe impulse response using other excitation signals, thereby \nenabling the use of loudspeaker sound sources. These sources \nfeature a better directivity, frequency spectrum and reproducibility \nthan impulsive sound sources, and offer increased dynamic range \nthrough deconvolution. Examples of suitable non-impulsive \nexcitation signals are the MLS (maximum length sequence) \nsignal, the sweep or swept sine (sine with frequency increasing \nlinearly or exponentially with time), white noise and pink noise.\nUse Case\nIn this use case, a recently constructed office building has an open-\nplan office, and DIRAC is used to verify the acoustic performance \nof the room in accordance with the ISO 3382-3 standard.\nThe measurements require a calibrated sound source, and DIRAC \ncontains the tools to perform such a calibration in a diffuse-field \n(reverberation chamber) or in a free-field setting. The \nmeasurements start with a standard level calibration of the \nFig. 2  DIRAC measurement in an open-plan office. Impulse responses are \nmeasured at different workstations. All ISO 3382-3-relevant room acoustic \nparameters can be calculated from these parameters\nThe loudspeaker source is positioned at one of the workstations \n(S2) and a sound level meter (SLM) is moved in turn to each \nmeasurement position (R1 \u2013 R9).",

When using traffic noise, the indoor \nand outdoor sound levels must be measured simultaneously, \nrequiring 2-channel measurements (Type 2270 only).\nImpact Sound Insulation\nImpact sound is typically caused by footsteps, and to measure \nimpact sound insulation a standardized impact sound source \n(tapping machine) is placed in the source room. The receiving \nroom levels are measured as for airborne sound insulation, with \nseveral positions of the tapping machine. Calculations are like \nthose for airborne sound insulation, except the results represent \nabsolute (not relative) levels.\nAnalysis and Reporting using Building Acoustics Partner\nWith a BZ-7350 licence, you can export building acoustics \nmeasurement projects created on Type 2250/2270 from \nMeasurement Partner Suite BZ-5503 directly to Building Acoustics \nPartner PC app for detailed measurement analysis and reporting.\nGain insight from the data. Measurement data is presented in \ninteractive graphical and tabular displays for maximum insight \nand confidence in your data. \nCompare levels from different measurement points. Quickly \ncompare levels in the source and receiving rooms and view \nmicrophone positions within the context of the room average, \nwith the option to include or exclude each position in the average.\nView reverberation time decays and spectra. Side-by-side \ndisplays of the reverberation time decays and spectrum allow you \nto view measurement data for each octave band.\nOverride data manually. It is possible to override all data. Adjust \nthe slope of the decay, if needed, or edit data to test theories \nabout the effects of changes you can make to get specific results. \nData edited in this way is marked so the manual changes are \nvisible. Should you want to remove the edits, the original data will \nstill be available.\nExport the data. To perform custom analysis or check \ncalculations, or to upload your data to a database, you can export \ndata to Microsoft Excel\u00ae.\nCreate reports. Customize the look and feel of your reports while \nconforming to the reporting requirements of the standard used. \nInclude multiple partitions in a single report for building surveys.",

DIRAC uses \nthis principle as the basis for measuring the acoustical properties \nof a system through impulse responses.\nFig. 1  Basic principle of impulse response measurement\nImpulse Responses\nThe mathematical impulse, or Dirac delta function, named after \nthe theoretical physicist Paul A.M. Dirac, is infinitely short and has \nunit energy. A linear, time-invariant system\u2019s response to such an \nimpulse contains all the information on the system and, as such, \nis convenient for analysis and storage. DIRAC measures and \nsaves acoustical impulse responses and calculates acoustical \nparameters from impulse responses.\nOther Excitation Signals\nThrough the method of deconvolution, DIRAC can also calculate \nthe impulse response using other excitation signals, thereby \nenabling the use of loudspeaker sound sources. These sources \nfeature a better directivity, frequency spectrum and reproducibility \nthan impulsive sound sources, and offer increased dynamic range \nthrough deconvolution. Examples of suitable non-impulsive \nexcitation signals are the MLS (maximum length sequence) \nsignal, the sweep or swept sine (sine with frequency increasing \nlinearly or exponentially with time), white noise and pink noise.\nUse Case\nIn this use case, a recently constructed office building has an open-\nplan office, and DIRAC is used to verify the acoustic performance \nof the room in accordance with the ISO 3382-3 standard.\nThe measurements require a calibrated sound source, and DIRAC \ncontains the tools to perform such a calibration in a diffuse-field \n(reverberation chamber) or in a free-field setting. The \nmeasurements start with a standard level calibration of the \nFig. 2  DIRAC measurement in an open-plan office. Impulse responses are \nmeasured at different workstations. All ISO 3382-3-relevant room acoustic \nparameters can be calculated from these parameters\nThe loudspeaker source is positioned at one of the workstations \n(S2) and a sound level meter (SLM) is moved in turn to each \nmeasurement position (R1 \u2013 R9).",

The microphone converts the sound signal to an equivalent electrical signal.\u00a0The electrical signal produced by the microphone is at a very low level and must be enhanced by a preamplifier, before reaching the main processor.\nSignal processing applies frequency weightings and time weightings to the signal, as specified by international standards such as IEC 61672 \u2013 1, which a sound level meter complies with.\nMEASUREMENT APPLICATIONS\nSound level meters and analyzers are used to measure and manage noise from a variety of sources. They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\nIn urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas. To ensure noise regulations are followed, noise is measured from a variety of sources as sports events, outdoor concerts, parks, and residential- or commercial neighbours. Each sound/noise source is defined by its own set of characteristics, which can pose challenges for the professionals assessing them.",

The microphone converts the sound signal to an equivalent electrical signal.\u00a0The electrical signal produced by the microphone is at a very low level and must be enhanced by a preamplifier, before reaching the main processor.Signal processing applies frequency weightings and time weightings to the signal, as specified by international standards such as IEC 61672 \u2013 1, which a sound level meter complies with.\n\nSound level meters and analyzers are used to measure and manage noise from a variety of sources. They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\n\nIn urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas. To ensure noise regulations are followed, noise is measured from a variety of sources as sports events, outdoor concerts, parks, and residential- or commercial neighbours. Each sound/noise source is defined by its own set of characteristics, which can pose challenges for the professionals assessing them.\n\nThis will bring together HBM, Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r, nCode, ReliaSoft, and Discom brands, helping you innovate faster for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive world.\n\nThis will bring together HBM, Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r, nCode, ReliaSoft, MicroStrain and Discom brands, helping you innovate faster for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive world.",
