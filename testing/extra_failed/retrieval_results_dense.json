To ensure that the job is done correctly, the app offers a complete implementation of task- and job-based noise exposure assessment according to ISO 9612.\n\nOnce the Work Noise Partner app is downloaded to your phone from the App Store®, all Work Noise Partner capabilities can be wirelessly controlled from your phone. Additionally, the mobile app organizes measurements into tasks and exposure groups and allows workday noise exposure calculations, where the user assigns a task duration to calculate a dose. Via the app interface, pictures, text and voice notes, and videos can be embedded with the measurements.\n\nWhen the survey is finished, the data can be transferred to a PC, wirelessly or with the supplied USB cable. Just like the mobile app, the Work Noise Partner PC app organizes measurements into tasks or exposure groups that can then be added to a workday exposure calculation. If the mobile app has been used to organize measurements or calculate workday noise exposures, they can be imported to your PC. To further minimize the need for additional training, the software is preconfigured with the tools needed to calculate exposure, create formatted reports, export data and calculations to a Microsoft®Excel®spreadsheet.\n\nThe Work Noise Partner PC software also works with Personal Noise Dosimeter Type 4448. You can import measurements from the dose meter into a Work Noise Partner project and combine that data with measurements from HBK 2255 to compare and analyse as needed. A separate licence is not required.\n\nOther task-focused apps for HBK 2255 sound level meter include:\n\nThis will bring together HBM, Brüel & Kjær, nCode, ReliaSoft, and Discom brands, helping you innovate faster for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive world.\n\nThis will bring together HBM, Brüel & Kjær, nCode, ReliaSoft, MicroStrain and Discom brands, helping you innovate faster for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive world.",

The microphone converts the sound signal to an equivalent electrical signal. The electrical signal produced by the microphone is at a very low level and must be enhanced by a preamplifier, before reaching the main processor.\nSignal processing applies frequency weightings and time weightings to the signal, as specified by international standards such as IEC 61672 – 1, which a sound level meter complies with.\nMEASUREMENT APPLICATIONS\nSound level meters and analyzers are used to measure and manage noise from a variety of sources. They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\nIn urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas. To ensure noise regulations are followed, noise is measured from a variety of sources as sports events, outdoor concerts, parks, and residential- or commercial neighbours. Each sound/noise source is defined by its own set of characteristics, which can pose challenges for the professionals assessing them.",

To ensure that the job is done correctly, the app offers a complete implementation of task- and job-based noise exposure assessment according to ISO 9612.\n\nOnce the Work Noise Partner app is downloaded to your phone from the App Store®, all Work Noise Partner capabilities can be wirelessly controlled from your phone. Additionally, the mobile app organizes measurements into tasks and exposure groups and allows workday noise exposure calculations, where the user assigns a task duration to calculate a dose. Via the app interface, pictures, text and voice notes, and videos can be embedded with the measurements.\n\nWhen the survey is finished, the data can be transferred to a PC, wirelessly or with the supplied USB cable. Just like the mobile app, the Work Noise Partner PC app organizes measurements into tasks or exposure groups that can then be added to a workday exposure calculation. If the mobile app has been used to organize measurements or calculate workday noise exposures, they can be imported to your PC. To further minimize the need for additional training, the software is preconfigured with the tools needed to calculate exposure, create formatted reports, export data and calculations to a Microsoft®Excel®spreadsheet.\n\nThe Work Noise Partner PC software also works with Personal Noise Dosimeter Type 4448. You can import measurements from the dose meter into a Work Noise Partner project and combine that data with measurements from HBK 2255 to compare and analyse as needed. A separate licence is not required.\n\nOther task-focused apps for HBK 2255 sound level meter include:\n\nThis will bring together HBM, Brüel & Kjær, nCode, ReliaSoft, and Discom brands, helping you innovate faster for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive world.\n\nThis will bring together HBM, Brüel & Kjær, nCode, ReliaSoft, MicroStrain and Discom brands, helping you innovate faster for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive world.",
