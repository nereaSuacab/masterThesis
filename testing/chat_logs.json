    "response": "Based on your requirement of having a portable noise monitoring system, I think you might be interested in using the Enviro Noise Partner application and its companion device (MPS). The MPS can store data from multiple instrument setups, making it suitable for portable use.\n\nTo set up this solution:\n\n1. Open an existing project or create a new one on your MPS.\n2. Choose a template that suits your noise monitoring needs.\n3. Select the data you want to import into Enviro Noise Partner (e.g., sound levels).\n4. Export the selected data from MPS using the \"Export to Enviro Noise Partner\" option.\n\nThis setup allows for easy and portable noise monitoring, as the project is stored on the primary instrument (MPS).<hr>Sources: \n\n\n\n1. output_UserGuide-Enviro noise Partner.txt (page -) \n\n<hr>\n\n",
