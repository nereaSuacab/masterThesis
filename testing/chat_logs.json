    "response": "The HBK 2755 Smart Power Amplifier doubles as a sound device that is optimal for DIRAC and easily drives the OmniPower Type 4292-L, which makes it suitable for insulation measurements. However, since you are asking about driving the OmniPower in concert hall reverberation tests (which implies ISO 3382 compliant measurements), according to Fig. 13 The omnidirectional sound source OmniPower Type 4292-L is recommended for ISO 3382 compliant measurements and no specific amplifier model was mentioned as being required, but it does mention that a loudspeaker sound source can be used instead of an impulsive sound source in these tests.\n\nHowever, based on the context provided earlier (HBK 2755 Smart Power Amplifier doubles as a sound device...), we could infer that HBK 2755 is suitable for driving OmniPower Type 4292-L.<hr>Sources: \n\n\n\n1. output_PRODUCT DATA - Dirac SW.txt (page -) \n\n<hr>\n\n",
