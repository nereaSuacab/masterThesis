All measurement capabilities are available from the app, with intuitive measurement profile screens that enable you to pinch the graph to zoom or swipe it to move back and forth through time.  This makes it very easy to mark events and isolate sounds so that you can, for example, exclude a barking dog from a measurement.  Measurement audio can be streamed to your phone while measuring, useful in situations where you cannot be physically close to the sound level meter, or to listen for wind-induced noise.  Via the app interface, pictures, text and voice notes, and videos can be embedded with the measurements to document your work.\n\n With the accompanying PC app, all data can be transferred to a PC, wirelessly or with the supplied USB cable.
