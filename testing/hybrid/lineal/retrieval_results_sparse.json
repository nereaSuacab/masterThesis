By default, the instrument selects the first microphone cartridge/preamplifier pair with the\ncorrect preamplifier for the Microphone setting.\nIt is important that the instrument knows the type of sound field in which you are measuring so it can apply the appro-\npriate correction to your measurements. These corrections will enhance the overall frequency response of the system\nregardless of whether or not the microphone you are using is designed for the sound field in which you are measuring.\nl Choose Free-field if you are in an environment with no (or very few) objects or surfaces that will reflect sound.\nFree-field sounds generally come from the sound source.\nl Choose Diffuse-field if you are in an environment with a lot of objects or surfaces that reflect sound. Diffuse-field\nsounds come randomly from all angles (random incidence) due to reflection off surfaces within the environment.\n\u2710Note: Generally, ISO requires free-field conditions and ANSI requires diffuse-field conditions. Be sure to check your\nlocal standards for the setting you require.",
