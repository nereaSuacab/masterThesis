A calibration check is not a calibration. Calibration includes an adjustment of the instrument's sensitivity.\nA calibration check compares the current sensitivity of the instrument with the sensitivity from its most recent and ini-\ntial calibrations, checking that it has not changed too much.\nWhen you place a sound calibrator on the microphone, the instrument detects the tone and automatically checks the\ndeviation of the sensitivity of the instrument from its initial calibration.",

They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\nIn urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas. To ensure noise regulations are followed, noise is measured from a variety of sources as sports events, outdoor concerts, parks, and residential- or commercial neighbours. Each sound/noise source is defined by its own set of characteristics, which can pose challenges for the professionals assessing them.",
