Based on the measurement and analysis of \nimpulse responses, DIRAC supports a variety of measurement \nconfigurations.  For accurate measurements according to the \nISO 3382 standard, you can use internally or externally generated \nstimulus signals through a loudspeaker sound source.\n Wireless and multi-channel features enable fast measurement \nsetup and execution. \n Speech intelligibility measurements can be carried out in \ncompliance with the IEC 60268-16 standard through an artificial \nmouth-directional loudspeaker sound source, such as Echo Speech \nSource Type 4720, or through direct injection into a sound system, \ntaking into account the impact of background noise. \n DIRAC is a valuable tool not only for field and laboratory acoustics \nengineers, but also for researchers and educational institutions.
