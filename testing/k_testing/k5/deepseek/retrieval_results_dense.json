They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\n In urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas.  To ensure noise regulations are followed, noise is measured from a variety of sources as sports events, outdoor concerts, parks, and residential- or commercial neighbours.  Each sound/noise source is defined by its own set of characteristics, which can pose challenges for the professionals assessing them.\n\n",
