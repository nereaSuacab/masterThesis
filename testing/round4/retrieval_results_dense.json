All measurement capabilities are available from the app, with intuitive measurement profile screens that enable you to pinch the graph to zoom or swipe it to move back and forth through time.  This makes it very easy to mark events and isolate sounds so that you can, for example, exclude a barking dog from a measurement.  Measurement audio can be streamed to your phone while measuring, useful in situations where you cannot be physically close to the sound level meter, or to listen for wind-induced noise.  Via the app interface, pictures, text and voice notes, and videos can be embedded with the measurements to document your work.\n PC App\nWith the accompanying PC app, all data can be transferred to a PC, wirelessly or with the supplied USB cable.

The microphone converts the sound signal to an equivalent electrical signal. The electrical signal produced by the microphone is at a very low level and must be enhanced by a preamplifier, before reaching the main processor.\nSignal processing applies frequency weightings and time weightings to the signal, as specified by international standards such as IEC 61672 – 1, which a sound level meter complies with.\nMEASUREMENT APPLICATIONS\nSound level meters and analyzers are used to measure and manage noise from a variety of sources. They are often employed in environmental noise assessment from sound sources, such as industrial plants, road and rail traffic, and construction work.\nIn urban environments, noise pollution - or excessive noise exposure - directly affects the people who live and work in the affected areas.

These capabilities ensure that you get the right data for your job to do. Additionally, the sound level meter can make high-quality audio recordings to aid in identifying specific incidents.\nMobile App\nOnce the Enviro Noise Partner app is downloaded to your phone from the App Store\n®\n, your HBK 2255 sound level meter can be wirelessly controlled from your phone – you can even control multiple sound level meters simultaneously. All measurement capabilities are available from the app, with intuitive measurement profile screens that enable you to pinch the graph to zoom or swipe it to move back and forth through time. This makes it very easy to mark events and isolate sounds so that you can, for example, exclude a barking dog from a measurement. Measurement audio can be streamed to your phone while measuring, useful in situations where you cannot be physically close to the sound level meter, or to listen for wind-induced noise. Via the app interface, pictures, text and voice notes, and videos can be embedded with the measurements to document your work.\nPC App\nWith the accompanying PC app, all data can be transferred to a PC, wirelessly or with the supplied USB cable. Just like the mobile app, the Enviro Noise Partner PC app is an excellent tool for adding markers for events and isolating sounds for further investigation or exclusion. These tasks are made even easier with the app’s powerful audio playback tools, such as pitch-corrected, high-speed playback for reviewing long recordings. Measurements can be exported to customizable Microsoft\n®\nExcel\n®\ntemplates for fast, easy and consistent reporting.\n\nUSER SCENARIOS\nAttended environmental noise surveys of noise from commerce, industry and transportation\nMeasuring existing ambient noise levels for pre-project planning\nVerifying compliance with environmental noise regulations\nInvestigating noise complaints\nADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES\nOther task-focused apps for HBK 2255 sound level meter include:\nWork Noise Partner – evaluate workplace noise to ensure compliance with regulations and safeguard employee safety, including determining the need and level for hearing protection.",
